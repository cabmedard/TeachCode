### Meta: 
* 3 hr first session 
* No previous coding experience
* Focusing on C# because that is what I know the best and C# is now available in hankerrank, leetcode etc.

### Notes:
1. Download Visual Studio Community Edition. Add all C#, core, .NET plugins
2. Make a github account
3. Explain source control very briefly. 
    * Remember when you had to all write a paper together before Google Docs?  People would save their files and send them to each other and it was a pain to get the document to merge all the thoughts together
    * A Google Doc solution would not work because if someone hasn't  finished their thought, they will break the code for everyone else
    * Source Control == version control. Diary of what you did
4. Feedback loops. 
    * Learn how to shorten the feedback loop
    * Coding in the browser allows for quick feedback loops when you are first starting out
5. Coding in the browser vs. IDE. Browser is just your mock IDE
    * Code Academy
    * Codewars
6. Code Academy's "Learn C#"
    * Hello World! - Traditionally, a programmer's first program in a new language!
    * Objects vs Methods. Methods have parenthesis
    * Variables are buckets. You put things in the buckets to retrieve them later
    * String manipulation. The dollar sign means to look for a variable in {}
    * WriteLine outputs from the program (to the Console window)
    * ReadLine inputs into the program (from the Console window)
    * Computers are pedantic. Console.readline() will FAIL.
    * Comments are statements the computer ignores. You can "comment out" lines of code that you don't want to delete yet to tell the computer to not run them. You can also use comments to explain what you are doing or to make a todo list when doing homework. A comment line starts with this: `//`
7.  Branching in a program. IF statements.
    * if (A STATEMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE TRUE OR FALSE) {DO EVERYTHING IN HERE}
    * else 
    {if the if statement evaluates to false, do everything in here}
    * `==` is a comparison operator. It compares the thing on the left to the thing on the right. If they are equal, it returns a `boolean` that is `true`
8. Variables we discussed:
    * string - A string variable type holds text
    * boolean - A boolean variable type can only hold a `true` or a `false`
    * array - An array is a variable that holds other variables. An array is a type of `data structure`. We didn't go too in depth on arrays yet.
