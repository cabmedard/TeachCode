### Meta: 
* 3 hr first session 
* No previous coding experience
* Focusing on C# because that is what I know the best and C# is now available in hankerrank, leetcode etc.

### Notes:
1. Download Visual Studio Community Edition. Add all C#, core, .NET plugins
2. Make a github account
3. Explain source control very briefly. 
    * Remember when you had to all write a paper together before Google Docs?  People would save their files and send them to each other and it was a pain to get the document to merge all the thoughts together
    * A Google Doc solution would not work because if someone hasn't  finished their thought, they will break the code for everyone else
    * Source Control == version control. Diary of what you did
4. Feedback loops. 
    * Learn how to shorten the feedback loop
    * Coding in the browser allows for quick feedback loops when you are first starting out
5. Coding in the browser vs. IDE. Browser is just your mock IDE
    * Code Academy
    * Codewars
6. Code Academy's "Learn C#"
    * Hello World! - Traditionally, a programmer's first program in a new language!
    * Objects vs Methods. Methods have parenthesis
    * Variables are buckets. You put things in the buckets to retrieve them later
    * String manipulation. The dollar sign means to look for a variable in {}
    * WriteLine outputs from the program (to the Console window)
    * ReadLine inputs into the program (from the Console window)
    * Computers are pedantic. Console.readline() will FAIL.
    * Comments are statements the computer ignores. You can "comment out" lines of code that you don't want to delete yet to tell the computer to not run them. You can also use comments to explain what you are doing or to make a todo list when doing homework. A comment line starts with this: `//`
7. Branching in a program. IF statements.
    * if (A STATEMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE TRUE OR FALSE) {DO EVERYTHING IN HERE}
    * else 
    {if the if statement evaluates to false, do everything in here}
    * `==` is a comparison operator. It compares the thing on the left to the thing on the right. If they are equal, it returns a `boolean` that is `true`
8. We opened up Visual Studio and created our own `Console App` Program. 
    * We could take the code from the browser and paste it into the program. It was valuable to type it by hand though as that created a better understanding of what was going on. 
    * We reproduced the program that we were writing from the Code Academy website
9. Variables we discussed:
    * string - A string variable type holds text
    * boolean - A boolean variable type can only hold a `true` or a `false`
    * array - An array is a variable that holds other variables. An array is a type of `data structure`. We didn't go too in depth on arrays yet.
10. Random advice to keep you going: 
    * Be curious. Don't be a perfectionist. Code lets you test all your assumptions. If you think you understand something, ask yourself: "How can I test that?". Learn how to "play" with the code. This is how you can develop the skill to keep learning throughout your career. 

### Resource links
_There's no reason to pay for any subscription right now. There's tons of free content online at this stage_
* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - This is where the Try C# course is that we were covering. Doesn't have a lot of C# courses but it good to get you started.
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) - Has all kinds of coding challenges you can practice on. They are called `kata`. When you submit your code, you can see what other people submitted and learn from them. That is my favorite part. 
* [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) - Only mentioning this because it is popular and all over reddit. But it's the same thing as Codewars but IMO it's more annoying because it constantly tries to get you to pay for a subscription.
* [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) - Paid service with tons of videos on coding topics. Great for when you want to dig deeper. I will sometimes pay for only 1 month when I want to learn something new. I'll devote all the learning to come out of Pluralsight for that month and then cancel.
